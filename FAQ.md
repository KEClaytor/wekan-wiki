## What is Libreboard?
As already explained in detail in our [Readme][], Libreboard is an open-source _[kanban board][kanban]_ that lets you organize things in cards, and cards in lists.

## What is the difference between Libreboard and Trello?
The main difference between the two is that Libreboard is completely open source and available under a permissive license, that's why it has “Libre” in the name. That makes it possible to host it on your own server (or your company's or organization's server) and you keep the full control over all data. No need to fear it will disappear some day, like a commercial service like Trello could.  
Additionally the long term goal is to have features that are not available on Trello or other alternative, making Libreboard flexible and suitable for complex project organizations.

## Why does Libreboard looks so different now compared to &lt; v0.9?
Libreboard started as a just for fun project to explore meteor and it's features and the initial version had a lot of the Trello assets (CSS, Images, Fonts) in it and copied a lot of it's design. Due to an DMCA takedown notice and obviously to get a own identify, the old design was dropped after v0.8 and development on a new UI has begun.<br /> See the related tickets [#92] and [#97] for more information.
