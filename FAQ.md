## What is Wekan?
As already explained in detail in our [Readme][], Wekan is an open-source _[kanban board][kanban]_ that lets you organize things in cards, and cards in lists.

## Weren't you called Libreboard before?
Yes, Libreboard was the old project name, which superseded the even older project name Metrello. As the original name suggests, Metrello was a Trello clone built with Meteor. It used a lot of the original assets from Trello and even the name was very similar. When the project turned more mature and gained more interest by the community, this was obviously a problem. To get it's own identity and due to a DMCA from Trello, efforts started to [redesign] Metrello, which also included to find a new name and so Maxime Quandalle came up with “OpenBoard”, to underline the open source nature of the project. Unfortunately the com domain was already taken and so she replaced the Open with Libre, which stands for free (as in freedom) in many Latin derived languages.

After renaming it to Libreboard, a [new logo] was designed and the project continued to live on as Libreboard. Unfortunately it turned out, that the new logo was apparently ripped-off from a [concept] published at Dribbble, and so a new logo had to be found. There were a lot of [ideas from the community][logo-ticket], and at the end Maxime [proposed][wekan-proposal] a completely new name, Wekan, together with a design proposal for a new logo.

## What is the difference between Wekan and Trello?
The main difference between the two is that Wekan is completely open source and available under the permissive MIT license. That makes it possible to host it on your own server (or your company's or organization's server) and you keep the full control over all data. No need to fear it will disappear some day, like a commercial service like Trello could.  
Additionally the long term goal is to have features that are not available on Trello or other alternative, making Wekan flexible and suitable for complex project organizations.

## Why does Wekan looks so different now compared to < v0.9?
Wekan started as a just for fun project to explore meteor and it's features and the initial version had a lot of the Trello assets (CSS, Images, Fonts) in it and copied a lot of it's design. Due to an DMCA takedown notice and obviously to get a own identify, the old design was dropped after v0.8 and development on a new UI has begun.<br /> See the related tickets [#92] and [#97] for more information.
