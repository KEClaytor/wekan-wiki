Wekan uses GFM (Github Flavored Markdown).
We use the following project that ports GFM to meteor: https://github.com/perak/markdown.

For guides, just search the web. github offers a [guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and the [GFM list of features](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
