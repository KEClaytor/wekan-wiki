Case: Implementing [EU General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) with Wekan and Sandstorm

I (xet7) was this week at [Drupalcamp Nordics 2017](http://www.drupalcampnordics.com) and got more details about this regulation, so I started implementing this yesterday in the way I understand it currently, using technologies I'm most familiar with, Wekan and Sandstorm.
