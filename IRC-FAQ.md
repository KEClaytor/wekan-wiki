Q: 2018-11-07
```
[12:50:46] <gros> hey
[12:53:45] <gros> I won't whine, because I know sometimes it is hard to answers to user's questions, but I'm here
since several days, I see that other users asks some things, and no one is answering
[12:58:11] <gros> I think that you could close this channel in fact, it will make win time for users
[12:58:24] <gros> and again I don't whine, thanks for the great Wekan :)
```
A: Very often when I look at questions at IRC channel, the person that asked question is not on channel anymore. That makes very hard to answer. So, I will add answers to this FAQ. I will keep IRC available, there is no plans to close IRC channel. Many prefer IRC, because IRC takes much less RAM than [webbrowser/mobile Wekan chat](https://chat.vanila.io/channel/wekan). I usually have IRC client always open, but if I'm not online, I don't see your question. If getting answer is important, [add new GitHub issue](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues) or get [Commercial Support](https://wekan.team/commercial-support/index.html).
