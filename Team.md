This page is in progress, more team members will be added later.

* Wekan is [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) and [Free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software)
* Wekan is not not a product, or in any way finished. There are missing features. 
* Wekan team is small. There is no benevolent dictator.
* Every Wekan team member is free to choose what to contribute and when.
  We can not force anybody to implement anything.
* We totally rely on pull requests for new features and bug fixes. If your pull request
  works, it's very likely to be accepted by xet7.
* There are near to zero tests, because nobody has contributed tests as pull request.
* Being popular feature request does not mean that feature will be implemented.
  It just means that nobody has needed that feature so much to even try to implement 
  it themselves and submit pull request, or find some depeloper and pay him/her to 
  implement it and submit pull request.
* Wekan is used by some big companies that employ 1000+ people and have some
  developer working to add features to Wekan.
* We have no stats what features of Wekan is done at free time of developers, and what
  feature was originally paid by some work to clients.
