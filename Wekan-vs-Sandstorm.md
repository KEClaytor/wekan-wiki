In totally oversimplified level skipping totally too much details, both Wekan and Sandstorm have:

* Authentication
* Admin Panel
* Wekan kanban board
* Can run on Ubuntu 16.04 64bit, including [Sandstorm inside Docker](https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/install/#option-6-using-sandstorm-within-docker)

For some, difference is [the user interface in Sandstorm](https://discourse.wekan.io/t/sso-passing-variables-through-url/493/8). For just only Wekan, there is ongoing work on on [Themes feature](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/781).
